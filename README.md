# Clean Clippings

Designed to be something of a helper for my much larger "brain".

Essentially, I needed to be able to take the clippings.txt file from my amazon kindle, which holds all of my highlights from any given text, and remove all duplicate data as well as reformat the lines such that I can use the new file for bulk insertion of the aforementioned highlights into a database.

I envision this functionality as being packaged into some command line application such that I could type ```clean-clipping "file"``` and instantly have the old clippings.txt file replaced by a new one of the same name, ready to be used in my other program.

Realistically, since I tend to read one book at a time, I imagine I'd have one clippings.txt per book, and have the information easily backed up on the cloud in a format ready to be parsed by "brain".
